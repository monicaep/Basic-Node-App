1. What is a Node module?

A Node module is like a Javascript library. It is a set of functions to include in your app.

2. What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

`module.exports` is the object returned from `require()` while `exports` is a reference to `module.exports`.

3. Why is using `exports` recommended?
If you want your module to be a specific object type you should use `module.exports`, otherwise you should use `exports`.
`module.exports` can be overwritten in your module with an assignment operation, which can result in errors / unexpected behaviors.
By using `exports` you can avoid this issue.
